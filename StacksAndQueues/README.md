## Intro:

This repository contains everything you need to know about the Stacks & Queues. It is primarily divided in two parts in following manner:

- Implementation & Operation: 
This directory contains the implementation of Stacks & Queues in Python from scratch. Do remember that stacks and queues can be implemented in multiple ways using different data structures like arrays/linked lists. So it's possible that our implementations might differ. Each implementation files contain basic operations that can be performed on the stacks like push and pop.

- Application & Interview:
This directory contains implementation of various applications of Stacks & Queues and common questions that can be seen on the coding interview. 


## Technical Details:
- **Stacks:**

| Operation          | Average Case | Worst Case      |
| -----              | -----        | -----           |
| Access			      | O(n)         | O(n)            |
| Search			      | O(n)     		| O(n)        		|
| Insertion				| O(1)			| O(1)				|
| Deletion				| O(1)			| O(1)				|


- **Queues:**

| Operation          | Average Case | Worst Case      |
| -----              | -----        | -----           |
| Access             | O(n)         | O(n)            |
| Search             | O(n)         | O(n)            |
| Insertion          | O(1)         | O(1)            |
| Deletion           | O(1)         | O(1)            |

## Status:
A lot of implementations are complete in the repository but I am still working on adding more stuff and improving the code style so it becomes easier for the readers to use it. Thank you for the patience.
