## Intro:
- **Need to be added**

## Structure:

This repository contains everything you need to know about the Hash Tables. It is primarily divided in two parts in following manner:

- Implementation & Operation: 
This directory contains the implementation of different types of hash tables and hash functions in Python from scratch. Each implementation files contain basic operations that can be performed on those linked lists including insertion, removal, and access. To resolve collission, we also implement open and closed hashing approaches. More advanced operations like hash table resizing are also implemented whenever a specific load is exceeded in the hash table. The threshold are pre-set in the code, but it can be adjusted as per the needs.

- Application & Interview:
This directory contains implementation of various applications of Hash Tables and common questions that can be seen on the coding interviews.

## Technical Details:

- **Chaining/Bucketing/Open Hashing/Closed Addressing:**
- **NOTE**: The time complexities below (and our implementations) assume that we are handling duplicates.

| Operation          	| Average Case 	| Worst Case      	|
| -----              	| -----        	| -----           	| 
| Access			    | O(1)        	| O(n)            	| 
| Insertion				| O(1)			| O(n)				|
| Deletion				| O(1)			| O(n)				|
| Resize				| O(n)			| O(n)				|


- **Probing/Closed Hashing/Open Addressing:**
- **NOTE**: The time complexities below (and our implementations) assume that we are handling duplicates.

| Operation          	| Average Case 	| Worst Case      	|
| -----              	| -----        	| -----           	| 
| Access			    | O(1)        	| O(n)            	| 
| Insertion				| O(1)			| O(n)				|
| Deletion				| O(1)			| O(n)				|
| Resize				| O(n)			| O(n)				|




## Status:
**(vivekkhimani) [02/05/2020]** - Initiated the directory and laid down the implementations that need to be done along with the details. The applications and interview part is yet to be initiated.

## Interesting Problems:
**(vivekkhimani) [02/05/2020]** - Will get started with this one soon!
