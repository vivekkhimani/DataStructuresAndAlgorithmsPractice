# WELCOME
 
- Thank you for your interest in contributing to this repository. 
- As the repository is currently being built, there are no major bug fixes. 
- The priority is to generate more content with a well-commented, organized, and documented code. 
- Currently, I am planning to cover the topics that are listed in the "Index" section of the main README.md file. If you feel that I am missing something, feel free to generate a pull request. 

### Basic Instructions:
- Every topic covered on the "Index" section of main README.md file needs to have a seperate directory. Let's address such specific directories for each topic as "Topic Directories".
- Each "Topic Directory" should contain a README.md file which is further divided in 3 sections - Intro, Technical Details, Status, and Interesting Problem. 
	- **Intro** - May contain basic information about the data structure and the information about how the directory is organized. 
	- **Technical Details** - This is the most important part as it contains information about the Big-O runtime while performing various operations on those data structures. There cannot be a specific structure for this one as it varies for different data structures but try to be consistent with the other "Topic Directories".
	- **Status** - This section informs the viewers and other developers about the current status of the "Topic Directory". It may include details about the completed and pending algorithms, completeness of the interview questions, reliability of the code already present in the repository, and more. 
	- **Interesting Problem** - This is an open for discussion section where open-source community can get together and work on interesting or trending problems related to the data structure. Once the problem is solved, it will not be removed from the list, but we will acknowledge the user who has solved the problem by adding their name on the README.md file. 
- I have started contributing for 3 topics in the list. Please feel free to check those "Topic Directories" and try to understand the structure. 


### Code Style:
I acknowledge and understand that data structures and algorithms can be coded in diverse manners. We are completely open to all the different kind of implementation but to uphold the motivation behind creating this repository, we will all try and follow some basic rules while writing the code. 

- All the .py files should be named consistently as per the other files present in the CWD. For example, if all the algorithms in the sorting directory are named using a camel-case convention, we will all try and follow that.
- All the .py files should contain a header which contains the following information:
	- **Description of the algorithm.**
	- **Big O time complexity (Average/Best/Worst if possible)**
	- **Tips** (Any professional tips about the usage of this algorithm in the practical world)
	- **Status** (The current status of the file. If the algorithms is complete, working, or incomplete)


### Pull Requests:
- If you have any interesting content to contribute, please follow the appropriate procedure to generate a pull request.
- We will try to approve the request and merge as soon as possible. 

Thank you for the interest once again. Let's make it big together!
