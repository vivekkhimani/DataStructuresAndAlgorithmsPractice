## Intro:

This directory contains the implementation of various searching and sorting algorithms that are commonly talked about, used, or frequently appear on the interviews. Along with implementations in Python, I have also provided details like algorithm description, running speed, and some tips for practical usage.

The directory is divided into two groups in following manner:

- Searching:
This directory contains the implementation of most popular searching algorithms - the linear and binary search. The binary search is implemented in recursive and iterative manner. The repository will also contain applications and frequently appearing questions on the interview.

- Sorting:
This directory contains the implementation of most commonly seen search algorithms - merge sort, quick sort, bubble sort, selection sort, shell sort, counting sort, heap sort, radix sort. The repository will also contain applications and frequently appearing questions on the interview.

## Technical Details:
To be added real soon.

## Status:
Searching implementations have been completed. The applications are yet to be added. I am currently working on the sorting implementations and expecting it to complete it soon. The sorting applications will also be added later.
