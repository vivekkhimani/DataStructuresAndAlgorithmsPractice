## Intro:
- **NEED TO BE ADDED**


## Structure:

This directory contains the implementation of various searching and sorting algorithms that are commonly talked about, used, or frequently appear on the interviews. Along with implementations in Python, I have also provided details like algorithm description, running speed, and some tips for practical usage.

The directory is divided into two groups in following manner:

- Searching:
This directory contains the implementation of most popular searching algorithms - the linear and binary search. The binary search is implemented in recursive and iterative manner. The repository will also contain applications and frequently appearing questions on the interview.

- Sorting:
This directory contains the implementation of most commonly seen search algorithms - merge sort, quick sort, bubble sort, selection sort, shell sort, counting sort, heap sort, radix sort. The repository will also contain applications and frequently appearing questions on the interview.

## Technical Details:
- **Searching:**


| Algorithm    		| Best Case		| Worst Case		| Average Case		|
| -----    				| -----       	| -----           | -----				|
| Linear Search		|  O(1)     	| O(n)         	| O(n)				|		
| Binary Search		|  O(1)     	| O(log n)        | O(log n)			|


- **Sorting:**


| Algorithm          | Best Case    | Worst Case      | Average Case    |
| -----              | -----        | -----           | -----           |
| Bubble Sort	      |	O(n)		   | O(n^2)		      | O(n^2)		      |
| Selection Sort     |  O(n^2)		| O(n^2)				| O(n^2)				|
| Insertion Sort		|	O(n)			| O(n^2)			 	| O(n^2)				|
| Merge Sort			|	O(nlogn)		| O(nlogn)			| O(nlogn)			|
| Quick Sort			|	O(nlogn)		| O(n^2)				| O(nlogn)			|
| Radix Sort			|	O(n)			| O(n)				| O(n)				|
| Heap Sort				|	O(n)			| O(nlogn)			| O(nlogn)			|
| Counting Sort		|	O(n+k)		| O(n+k)				| O(n+k)				|


## Status:
- **(vivekkhimani) [01/21/2020]** - Searching implementations have been completed. All the sorting algorithms **except** Radix Sort, Counting Sort, Heap Sort have been done as well. The applications & interview questions are pending.


## Interesting Question:
- **(vivekkhimani) [01/21/2020]** - Will soon get started on this one.
