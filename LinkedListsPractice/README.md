## Intro:

This repository contains everything you need to know about the Linked Lists. It is primarily divided in two parts in following manner:

- Implementation & Operation: 
This directory contains the implementation of different types of linked lists in Python from scratch. Each implementation files contain basic operations that can be performed on those linked lists including addition, deletions, reversal etc.

- Application & Interview:
This directory contains implementation of various applications of Linked Lists and common questions that can be seen on the coding interview. 


## Status:
A lot of implementations are complete in the repository but I am still working on adding more stuff and improving the code style so it becomes easier for the readers to use it. Thank you for the patience.
